# Custom Prompts for PowerShell and Zsh

## Description

This is a repository that includes custom prompts for
[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) and
[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/). PowerShell is often used in Windows, while Zsh is
available on macOS and Linux.

### Background

While using Linux, I set a custom prompt for Zsh to display three pieces of
information: my username, my current working folder, and my git branch. When I
worked on macOS, the same script worked! However, when I worked on Windows, it
would not work.

The point of these scripts is to provide a neater and more standardized shell
prompts across my computers.
