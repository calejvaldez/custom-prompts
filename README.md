# Custom Prompts for PowerShell, Zsh, and Bash

## Description

This is a repository that includes custom prompts for
[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/),
[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), and [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).
PowerShell is often used in Windows, Zsh in macOS, and Bash in Linux.

### Background

While using Linux, I set a custom prompt for Bash to display three pieces of
information: my username, my current working folder, and my git branch. When I
worked on macOS, the same script worked! However, when I worked on Windows, it
would not work.

The point of these scripts is to provide a neater and more standardized shell
prompts across my computers.
